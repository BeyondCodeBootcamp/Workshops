## Interactive Shell

## Scripting

**Posix Shell**

(Scripting)

---

The _NOT_-Bash Parts

(Learn to *Un*learn)

---

## Part 1.5 Continued

---

# TREL

---

-   **T**ry
-   **R**ead (what's on the screen)
-   **E**valuate (with your human brain)
-   **L**oop (back to try again)

---

The equal and opposite of the REPL.

<small>(the human loop between your fingers, the screen, and your brain)</small>

---

# REPL

---

-   **R**ead (from the keyboard)
-   **E**valuate (syntax and expressions)
-   **P**rint (the error or result)
-   **L**oop

---

There is no magic.

<small>(the computer does what you say, not what you <em>want</em>)</small>

---

## 0. Pre-req

---

### 0.1 Webi

Make sure `webi` is installed.

```sh
curl -sS https://webi.sh/ | sh
```

---

### 0.2 Interactive Shell

(exercises ahead)

---

Get back into `fish`.

```sh
fish
```

If that fails:

```sh
webi fish
```

TREL. And try again.

---

### 0.3 Temp Directory

(junk and test files ahead)

---

Go to the temp directory.

<small>(and make sure you're there)</small>

```sh
pwd
```

```sh
pushd /tmp/
pwd
```

```sh
popd
pwd
```

```sh
pushd /tmp/
```

---

## 1. Interactive Concepts

---

0. Eratta
1. Auto-complete
2. Text Navigation
3. Variables
4. Pipes
5. & Redirection

---

## 0. Eratta

<kbd>Ctrl ‚åÉ</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>

-   This is called "scroll lock".
-   It freezes _some_ shells (`bash`, `sh`), \
    but not all (e.g. `fish`)

<small>(nor any shell spawned from fish)</small>

---

Try in a terminal or console \
where `bash` is the parent shell:

```sh
find /
```

<kbd>Ctrl ‚åÉ</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>

<kbd>Ctrl ‚åÉ</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>

---

## 1.1 Autocomplete

11 out of 10 doctors agree:

> Typing is the leading cause of typos

---

Try browsing your history \
(or just typing letters) \
and test the autocomplete:

‚¨ÜÔ∏è

‚û°Ô∏è

üé© <kbd>tab</kbd> ü™Ñ

---

### 2. Navigation

**Goal**: Learn keyboard navigation.

(emacs-style and vim-style)

---

### 2.0 Some Tools

```sh
webi aliasman curlie bat jq
```

---

Note<span>: We won't use this "for real" until later.

<small>For now they'll just give us an excuse to explore some navigation.</small>

---

### 2.1 Beginning and End of Line

| Combo                            | Desc                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>Ctrl ‚åÉ</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> | A, the first letter,<br> goes to first character |
| <kbd>Ctrl ‚åÉ</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> | E for 'end'                                      |

<small>(fyi: these come from emacs, but are nearly-universally supported)</small>

---

### 2.2 Exercise

```sh
# type out this line      (alias 'setalias' as 'aliasman')
alias setalias='aliasman'

# but use up and ctrl + a to edit this line
setalias setalias='aliasman'
```

```sh
# get that muscle memory   (make our interactive cat a bat)
alias cat='bat --style=plain --pager=none'
setalias cat='bat --style=plain --pager=none'
```

```sh
# feel the burn!         (give our interactive curl colors)
alias curl='curlie'
setalias curl='curlie'
```

---

### Goal 1.1

Learn to diagnose unexpected results

(quotes, variables, and interpolation)

---

1. What do you think this will output?
    ```sh
    echo It's   $100   bills y'all
    ```
2. Try it.
3. Is anything different what what you thought?

---

1. What's different about this?
    ```sh
    echo "It's   $100   bills y'all"
    ```
2. What will it do differently?
3. Try it.
4. Is anything different what what you thought?

---

What about each of these?

```sh
echo It\'s   $100   bills y\'all
echo 'It\'s   $100   bills y\'all'
echo "It's   \$100   bills y'all"
echo \"It's   \$100   bills y'all\"
```

---

### Goal 1.2

The url I wanted to show is too long to fit on a slide.

---

That's okay. We can

1. Declare a variable (interactive shell syntax)
    ```sh
    export my_url='https://raw.githubusercontent.com'
    ```
2. Add more to that variable
    ```sh
    export my_url="$my_url/BeyondCodeBootcamp/shell-cheatsheet"
    export my_url="$my_url/main/README.md"
    ```
3. Use the variable (interactive shell syntax)
    ```sh
    curl -o ./NOTES.md \
        "$my_url"
    ```

---

```sh
vim ./NOTES.md
```

| <kbd>esc</kbd> | `:q!`  |
| -------------- | ------ |
| `/`            | search |
| <kbd>esc</kbd> | `:wq`  |

---

| <kbd>Shift ‚áß</kbd> | does the opposite or extreme |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `n`                | **n**ext                     |
| `N`                | _opposite_ of next           |
| `gg`               | **g**ood **g**ame # 1        |
| `G`                | opposite of #1               |
| `hjkl`             | awesome goes up to the right |

---

```sh
/bin/cat ./NOTES.md
cat ./NOTES.md
less ./NOTES.md
bat ./NOTES.md

rm ./NOTES.md
cat ./NOTES.md
```

---

```sh
curl "$my_url"

curl "$my_url" |
    bat

curl "$my_url" |
    less

curl "$my_url" \
    > ./NOTES.md

bat ./NOTES.md
```

---

```sh
curl "$my_url" \
    > ./NOTES.md \
    2> ./log.txt

bat ./log.txt
```

---

```sh
export my_url='https://api.github.com/search/issues'
export my_url="$my_url?q=type:pr+state:closed"
export my_url="$my_url+author:coolaj86"
export my_url="$my_url&per_page=2&page=1"
```

```sh
curl "$my_url"
curl "$my_url" > \
    ./gh-issues.json
```

---

```sh
bat ./gh-issues.json

bat < ./gh-issues.json

bat ./gh-issues.json |
    jq '.'

cat ./gh-issues.json |
    jq '.total_count'

jq '.total_count' < ./gh-issues.json
```

---

```sh
jq '.items' < ./gh-issues.json
jq '.items[]' < ./gh-issues.json
jq '.items[0]' < ./gh-issues.json
jq '.items[].url' < ./gh-issues.json
jq '.items[0].url' < ./gh-issues.json
```

|                `o` | **o**pen a new line below            |
